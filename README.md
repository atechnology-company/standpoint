## Imagine this

You have a set of things, and you want to show how much you like each item with your friends. What do you do?

You go over to Tiermaker, spend like 20 minutes collecting all the photos to download them to your computer, then upload them to the site, and then by the time you’ve finished doing all of that, your friends are all gone, you’re feeling demotivated, you’ve wasted 20 minutes and literally don’t want to do anything.

Okay, lets say that in the very limited repository of tier lists, Tiermaker actually already has one from it’s extremely dead community, you make your own copy, but it doesnt have everything you want, it also doesn’t have the look you want and the pictures are either wrong or theres no text so you don’t really know what you’re ranking or the other 50 problems that you may have.

Every single person born in the age of the New Internet can relate to this, and I think we all agree that this needs to change in the form of a new implementation and I’m here for it.

I want to make an app that people actually find useful and fun, that is made with modern day technology for a modern age of people that do want a purpose-built tool that is expressive and doesn’t look like it stopped evolving since 2012. I also want to make sure that its done in the most efficient, beautiful manner that exceeds your expectations on every open, something that goes against design norms to create a piece of art in an user interface that is fun to use.

Standpoint is a platform built for the New Internet centered around sharing opinions and creating tierlists. AI-powered, blazing quick and literally just my school project.
